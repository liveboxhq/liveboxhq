tl;dr - I am offering free chat support services for your restaurant's website. Send a message.

Your restaurant's website is not always up to date. Visitors often need to phone in to clarify opening hours, make inquiries about food items, etc. But your staff are busy people, so callers often get frustrated responses, ringing lines get missed. People do not enjoy making these phone calls either, but you lose potential customers when they don't call.

Livebox is a chat support service for restaurants. Communications are outsourced to the service, which lives as an instant messaging widget directly on your website for visitors to use.

The software is ready, but needs to be running on actual restaurant websites for its business value to be validated. The underlying principle is simple; if restaurants don't get value out of Livebox, then Livebox has no reason to exist, much less charge any fees.

I am hoping to achieve a win-win type of pilot program. You help me with validating the value in Livebox's product and services, and I help you with engaging website visitors to turn more of them into real customers.
